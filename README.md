# Researcher Tool

This tool automatically extracts the name of your research papers and the corresponding conclusion.

It then outputs them to an Excel file where you can navigate your research more easily.📈

## Usage

After cloning the repo, run the main.py file.

A prompt will ask you to enter the directory where you have stored all your research papers.
